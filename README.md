# GoodNightNews

<b> A Multi-Screen networking app that displays the latest news related to user's preference. The user can select what type of news
they want to be displayed; Games, Music, or Technology. </b> 

<p> Project #6 for the <b>Android Basics Nanodegree</b> by Google </p>

<p> This app focuses on understanding the power of Web APIs and how to use them in my apps. I learned the basics of networking in Android, 
including HTTP networking, JSON parsing, and threads. Goodnight News queries the content.guardianapis.com API to fetch news stories.
The stories are shown on the main screen update properly whenever new news data is fetched from the API. Goodnight News contains a main 
screen which displays multiple news stories. The title of the article, the name of the section that it belongs to as well as the
author's name and date published are easily visible. The Settings Activity is accessed from the Main Activity via the toolbar menu. 
The Settings Activity allows users to see the value of all the preferences right below the preference name, and when the value is changed, 
the query is narrowed down and the summary updates immediately. Networking operations are done using a Loader. 
Clicking on a story uses an intent to open the story in the userâ€™s browser. When there is no data to display, the app shows a 
default TextView that informs the user how to populate the list. The app checks whether the device is connected to the internet and 
responds appropriately. </p>
 
 <b>For this project, it was not required for the app to have images. To improve my Goodnight News app, I will add the 
 relevant images as thumbnails to the news article. </b>
